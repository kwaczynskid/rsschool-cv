> Summary

Hello, my name is Dominik I'am 27 years old and I'am living in Gdańsk. Since last year i work as a Magento Frontend Developer - it's result of my self-learning time when i started coding one year earlier. At the beginning I found some free, useful materials about frontend development and I tried to do some basic tasks to check that i will enjoy it. After i coded my first lines I bought professional course about HTML and CSS technologies and i started explore those languages after my full-time job.

I noticed that most of this stuff was very interesting for me so i started learning deeper. I learned html and css, responsive design, some seo rules and basics of javascript so that was good time to start focus on specific area like Magento. I started learn coding because i wanted have a well paid job where i can increase my potential to learn new things in frontend area. I believe that you can do what you like, earns good money and having good times after job, sharing best moments with your friends and thats my life goals.

> English Skills

At this time I have no much opportunities to speak english with people around because most of my friends are local so we speak polish. In the other hand i feel free to speak english in general - last year i visited four European countries where all this time i was speaking english with random people in everyday situations - I always came back in one piece, I didnt miss my plane in any of this country, I didnt starve so its sign for me that my english is useful enough to survive wherever I am
and feeling free to comunicate with people abroad.
I wish to speak more fluently with people from different countries so i believe thath working in big company is good chance to increase english skills.
